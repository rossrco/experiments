    "# What Is NLP?\n",
    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a set of methods for extracting information from text. But is text not already data and what would we extract? It is data, however it is represented as a continuous string of text like the one you are reading right now. The issue here is that statistics use numbers as input. So how do we make numbers out of text? Usually we break down the text into words. We can then one-hot encode the words and build a binary matrix. The columns of the matrix are the tokens, while the rows are the texts. We can then use the binary matrix as input to a range of numeric functions.\n",

    "# Word2Vec\n",
    "Word2Vec is a word embedding model that calculates the probability of a certain token being preceded or followed by a range of other tokens. The assumption is that positional co-occurrence is proportional to semantic relatedness (the so called 'distributional hypothesis'). The model itself represents each token as a vector of the probability of it being close to every other token in the entire dictionary of the corpus. We can then use the word vectors in their mathematical context. We can calculate the similarity between two words by taking the cosine of the angle between the corresponding vectors. We can calculate relationships between two terms and find the equivalent relationship in a third one by using vector subtraction.\n",

    "To demonstrate that, we will train a Word2Vec model on all articles related to computers. We will then see if the relationships between the terms in that context match our intuition. We will start by locating all news articles from the categories: `comp.os.ms-windows.misc`, `comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware`, `comp.sys.mac.hardware`, `comp.windows.x`, `sci.electronics`."
